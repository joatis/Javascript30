    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'John';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'J';
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

  

    // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); // Empty slice returns a whole new copy of the array values.
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concat the values of players into an empty array that is then assigned top the variable.
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heee hawww!';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); // create a new array using the prototype from() method.


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
